Get your first AI agent running in under 5 minutes. This guide walks you through creating an account, starting your first conversation, and deploying an agent to complete a task.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- An email address for account verification
- A task in mind to automate (we'll use email checking as an example)

## Step 1: Create Your Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit the web app">
    Navigate to [app.aventir.io](https://app.aventir.io)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Click "Get Started" and create an account with your email or Google authentication
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify email">
    Check your inbox for a verification email and confirm your account
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Start Your First Conversation

Once logged in, you'll see the AI Manager chat interface:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Introduce yourself">
    Tell the AI Manager what you do and what tasks you'd like to automate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your task">
    Example: "I want to check my Gmail every morning at 9 AM and summarize important emails"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the plan">
    The AI Manager will propose an agent configuration and ask for your approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Add Credentials (Optional)

For tasks requiring account access, you'll need to add credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Click **Settings** → **Credentials** in the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add new credential">
    Click "Add Credential" and select the service (e.g., Gmail)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter details">
    Provide your username and password. Credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Your credentials are encrypted and stored securely. Aventir cannot see your passwords in plain text.
</Info>

## Step 4: Deploy Your Agent

After reviewing the agent configuration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Approve the agent">
    Confirm the task description and any required credentials
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    The AI Manager will provision a virtual computer and deploy your agent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor progress">
    Watch real-time updates as your agent completes the task
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Daily Email Summary

Here's a complete example of setting up an email summary agent:

```
You: "I need to check my Gmail every morning at 9 AM and summarize 
       important emails from my team"

AI Manager: "I'll create a scheduled agent that:
            1. Logs into your Gmail at 9 AM daily
            2. Checks for unread emails from the last 24 hours
            3. Identifies emails from team members
            4. Sends you a summary via the chat
            
            This will require Gmail credentials and will use 
            approximately 200 credits per run."

You: "Sounds good, please proceed"

AI Manager: "Agent deployed successfully. Your first run will be 
            tomorrow at 9 AM. I'll notify you when results are ready."
```

## Understanding Credits

Each action consumes credits from your balance:

| Action | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| Typical agent run | 200 |
| Complex multi-step task | 600 |
| AI Manager chat message | 5 |
| Web research (per query) | 50 |

<Info>
Free tier includes 300 daily credits. Upgrade to Starter ($25/mo) for 4,000 monthly credits.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Failed to Start

- Check that you have sufficient credits
- Verify credentials are correct and not expired
- Ensure the task description is clear and specific

### No Results Returned

- The target website may have changed its layout
- The agent may need updated credentials
- Check the agent logs for specific error messages

### Credits Running Low

- Monitor usage in Settings → Billing
- Consider upgrading to a higher plan
- Purchase credit packs for one-time boosts
