# Memory System

Aventir implements a sophisticated memory system that allows agents to learn from experience and improve over time.

## Overview

The memory system includes:
- **Structured Memory** (Moltbot-style)
- **Semantic Memory** (A-Mem)
- **Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing**
- **Learning Networks**

## Structured Memory

Inspired by Moltbot, agents maintain four key documents:

### SOUL
Defines the agent's personality and working style.

### USER_CONTEXT
Stores facts about the user and preferences.

### LONG_TERM_MEMORY
Important learnings to preserve across sessions.

### WORKSPACE
Current task tracking and progress notes.

## Semantic Memory (A-Mem)

Vector-based memory retrieval using embeddings.

## Cross-Agent Knowledge

Learnings shared across all your agents for collective improvement.
