Aventir enables multiple agents to collaborate on complex workflows.

## Workflows

Chain agents together for multi-step automation:
- Linear workflows (sequential)
- Branching workflows (conditional)
- Parallel workflows (simultaneous)

## Shared Context

Agents share data through context store and state management.

## Handoffs

- Direct handoff between agents
- Event-driven triggers
- Scheduled coordination

## Example: Sales Pipeline

```
Lead → Qualify → Research → Score → Route → Notify
```

Each step handled by specialized agents.
