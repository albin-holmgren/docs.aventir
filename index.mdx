# Welcome to AVENTIR

Aventir is an AI-powered agent management platform that enables you to delegate tasks to autonomous AI agents running on virtual computers. Transform your workflows with intelligent automation that learns and improves over time.

## What is Aventir?

Aventir replaces repetitive computer-based tasks with autonomous AI agents. Unlike simple automation tools, Aventir agents:

- **Understand natural language** - Describe tasks in plain English
- **Operate real computers** - Navigate websites, use applications, handle emails
- **Learn from experience** - Get smarter with every task completion
- **Integrate with 21+ services** - Gmail, Slack, Shopify, HubSpot, and more
- **Work autonomously** - Run scheduled tasks without supervision
