## Troubleshooting

### High Resource Usage

**Symptoms:** Agent using excessive credits or time

**Investigate:**
1. Review task logs for stuck operations
2. Check for unnecessary screenshots
3. Analyze iteration count
4. Review error retries

**Solutions:**
- Optimize task description
- Reduce screenshot frequency
- Set iteration limits
- Adjust retry policies

### Declining Success Rate

**Symptoms:** Agent increasingly failing

**Common Causes:**
- Website changed UI
- Credentials expired
- Service API updated
- Rate limits tightened

**Solutions:**
- Update selectors in task
- Refresh credentials
- Review service documentation
- Reduce frequency

### Missing Expected Results

**Symptoms:** Agent completes but with no/limited findings

**Investigate:**
1. Check if data exists at scheduled time
2. Verify agent has correct access
3. Review task scope
4. Check for filtering criteria

## Best Practices

### Regular Review

Schedule monthly monitoring reviews:

- Review success rates
- Analyze credit usage trends
- Check for optimization opportunities
- Update alert thresholds

### Proactive Response

Address alerts promptly:

- Failed tasks: Investigate within 24 hours
- Credit warnings: Plan purchases in advance
- Health degradation: Optimize before failure

### Documentation

Document known issues:

```
Agent: Shopify Monitor
Known Issue: Occasional timeout on Tuesday mornings
Root Cause: Shopify maintenance window
Workaround: Schedule for 9 AM instead of 8 AM
Status: Monitoring
```
