The AI Manager is your conversational interface to Aventir. Powered by Claude Opus, it understands natural language requests and translates them into autonomous agent deployments.

## Starting a Conversation

Access the AI Manager through the web app at [app.aventir.io](https://app.aventir.io). The interface resembles modern chat applications with:

- Message history with context preservation
- Real-time streaming responses
- File and image attachments (coming soon)
- Voice mode for hands-free interaction

### Your First Message

Introduce yourself and describe what you'd like to automate:

```
"I'm a marketing manager at a SaaS company. I need help with 
social media monitoring, competitor research, and lead tracking."
```

The AI Manager will ask clarifying questions to understand:

- Which tools you use (LinkedIn, Twitter, HubSpot, etc.)
- Your workflow preferences
- Required credentials
- Desired frequency (one-time, daily, weekly)

## Creating Agents Through Chat

The primary way to create agents is by describing your task:

### Simple Task

```
"Check my Gmail for emails from john@company.com and summarize 
what he needs."
```

The AI Manager will:
1. Detect this requires Gmail access
2. Check if you have Gmail credentials stored
3. Create a one-time agent to complete the task
4. Report results in the conversation

### Complex Workflow

```
"Every Monday morning, I need to:
1. Check Shopify for weekend orders
2. Create a summary in Google Sheets
3. Post low-stock alerts to Slack
4. Email the report to my team"
```

The AI Manager will:
1. Break down into component tasks
2. Identify required integrations (Shopify, Google Sheets, Slack)
3. Propose a scheduled workflow
4. Create credentials if needed
5. Deploy agents with dependencies

## Understanding AI Manager Responses

### Task Proposals

When you request automation, the AI Manager responds with a plan:

```
I'll create a workflow that:

**Agent 1: Shopify Order Collector**
- Runs every Monday at 8 AM
- Downloads weekend order data
- Credits: 200 per run

**Agent 2: Report Generator**
- Updates Google Sheets with order summary
- Credits: 150 per run

**Agent 3: Slack Notifier**
- Posts low-stock items to #inventory channel
- Credits: 50 per run

**Agent 4: Email Sender**
- Emails complete report to team
- Credits: 100 per run

Total: 500 credits per Monday
Required: Shopify, Google, Slack credentials
```

### Agent Progress Updates

While agents run, you receive real-time updates:

```
[9:00 AM] Agent "Shopify Collector" started
[9:02 AM] Logged into Shopify successfully
[9:03 AM] Found 47 orders from weekend
[9:04 AM] Agent completed - extracted order data

[9:05 AM] Agent "Report Generator" started
[9:06 AM] Updated Google Sheet "Weekly Orders"
[9:07 AM] Agent completed
```

## Conversation Context

The AI Manager maintains context across your conversation:

- **Short-term**: Last 10 messages for immediate context
- **Long-term**: User profile, preferences, and history
- **Cross-conversation**: Learnings from all your agents

### Contextual Awareness

```
You: "The same thing for Tuesday"
AI Manager: "I'll set up the same Shopify → Sheets → Slack 
          workflow for Tuesday mornings?"
```

## Proactive Suggestions

The AI Manager learns your patterns and suggests optimizations:

### Suggestion Types

- **New agents** - Based on your activities
- **Schedule optimization** - Better timing based on your usage
- **Workflow improvements** - More efficient approaches
- **Integration opportunities** - Connecting your tools

### Example Suggestion

```
💡 Suggestion

I noticed you check Gmail and then manually create tasks in Notion 
every morning. Would you like me to create an agent that:

- Checks Gmail at 9 AM
- Extracts action items from emails
- Creates tasks in your Notion database
- Sends you a summary

This would save you approximately 15 minutes daily.
[Create Agent] [Not Now] [Never]
```

## Personalization

The AI Manager adapts to your communication style:

### Detected Preferences

- **Communication style**: Formal vs. casual
- **Detail level**: Brief summaries vs. comprehensive reports
- **Decision approach**: Ask for confirmation vs. act autonomously
- **Response timing**: Immediate vs. scheduled digests

### Setting Preferences

You can explicitly set preferences:

```
"Please keep responses brief and only ask for confirmation 
on tasks costing more than 500 credits."
```

## Managing Agents via Chat

### List Active Agents

```
"What agents do I have running?"
```

Response:
```
You have 4 active agents:

1. **Email Summarizer** (Daily, 9 AM)
   Last run: Today at 9:03 AM - Success
   
2. **LinkedIn Monitor** (Hourly)
   Status: Running now
   
3. **Shopify Reporter** (Weekly, Monday 8 AM)
   Next run: Tomorrow
   
4. **Competitor Tracker** (One-time)
   Status: Completed 2 hours ago
```

### Modify Agents

```
"Change the Email Summarizer to run at 8 AM instead of 9 AM"
```

```
"Pause the LinkedIn Monitor until next week"
```

### Stop Agents

```
"Stop the Shopify Reporter permanently"
```

## Best Practices

### Clear Task Descriptions

**Good:**
```
"Check my Gmail inbox every morning at 8 AM, find emails from 
clients with 'urgent' in the subject, and send me a Slack 
notification with the sender and subject line."
```

**Less Effective:**
```
"Check my email"
```

### Provide Context

Share relevant background information:

```
"I'm the VP of Sales. I need to track our HubSpot pipeline 
every Friday at 5 PM and share the forecast with the exec team."
```

### Iterate and Refine

Agents improve with feedback:

```
"That report was good, but can you also include deals that 
moved stages this week?"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Created

If the AI Manager can't create an agent:

1. **Check credentials** - Required services may need authentication
2. **Clarify the task** - Provide more specific instructions
3. **Check credit balance** - Insufficient credits prevent deployment
4. **Review limits** - You may have reached agent or task limits

### Unexpected Results

If an agent produces unexpected output:

1. **Describe the issue** - "The report included refunded orders"
2. **Specify corrections** - "Exclude orders with status 'refunded'"
3. **The AI Manager updates** - The agent configuration will be refined

### Conversation Lost

If you need to reference a previous conversation:

```
"Last week you created an agent to check Shopify. Can you 
modify it to also check inventory levels?"
```

## Voice Mode (Beta)

Enable voice mode for hands-free interaction:

1. Click the microphone icon in the chat
2. Speak naturally to describe tasks
3. The AI Manager transcribes and responds via text
4. Use voice for quick agent creation while mobile
