# Creating Agents

Agents are the core automation units in Aventir. This guide covers all the ways to create agents and configure them for your specific needs.

## Methods for Creating Agents

### 1. Via AI Manager Chat (Recommended)

The easiest way to create an agent is through natural language:

```
"Create an agent that checks my Gmail every morning at 9 AM 
and summarizes important emails."
```

The AI Manager will:
- Analyze your request
- Detect required skills (Gmail)
- Check for credentials
- Propose a configuration
- Deploy upon approval

### 2. Via Dashboard

For more control, use the web dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Agents** → **Create Agent**
2. Enter task description
3. Select schedule (one-time, daily, weekly, custom)
4. Choose required integrations
5. Review and deploy

### 3. Via API

Programmatically create agents using the REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.aventir.io/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Email Summarizer",
    "taskDescription": "Check Gmail and summarize important emails",
    "type": "scheduled",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * *",
    "requiredIntegrations": ["gmail"]
  }'
```

## Agent Configuration

### Required Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Name | Descriptive agent name | "Daily Email Summary" |
| Task Description | Detailed instructions | "Check Gmail for unread emails..." |
| Type | Execution pattern | one-time, scheduled, triggered |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Schedule | Cron expression for recurring runs | None |
| Credentials | Required service credentials | Auto-detected |
| Max Runtime | Maximum execution time (minutes) | 30 |
| Notifications | Alert destinations | In-app only |

## Task Description Best Practices

A good task description produces better results:

### Be Specific

**Good:**
```
"Check my Gmail inbox every morning at 8 AM. Find emails from 
addresses containing '@company.com' with subject lines containing 
'urgent' or 'action required'. Extract sender name, subject, and 
first 2 sentences. Send a Slack message to #alerts with this info."
```

**Less Effective:**
```
"Check my email"
```

### Include Context

Help the agent understand the business context:

```
"I'm the sales manager. Check HubSpot every Friday at 5 PM and 
create a summary of deals that moved to 'Closed Won' this week. 
Include deal value, company name, and contact person. Email the 
summary to sales-team@company.com."
```

### Specify Success Criteria

Define what "done" looks like:

```
"Monitor our Shopify store every hour. Alert me via email if:
- Any product has inventory < 10
- Any order has status 'payment_failed'
- More than 5 orders pending > 24 hours

Stop monitoring at 6 PM daily."
```

## Agent Types

### One-Time Agents

Execute once and complete. Ideal for:
- Research tasks
- Data extraction
- Migration projects
- Report generation

```
"Find the top 10 competitors in the AI automation space by 
searching Product Hunt and G2. Create a spreadsheet with 
company name, website, pricing, and key features."
```

### Scheduled Agents

Run on a recurring schedule. Ideal for:
- Daily reports
- Monitoring
- Maintenance tasks
- Regular updates

**Schedule Formats (Cron):**

| Schedule | Cron Expression |
|----------|-----------------|
| Daily 9 AM | `0 9 * * *` |
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` |
| Weekly Monday 8 AM | `0 8 * * 1` |
| Weekdays 5 PM | `0 17 * * 1-5` |

### Triggered Agents

Execute in response to events. Ideal for:
- New email received
- Order placed
- Form submitted
- Webhook received

```
"When a new order comes into Shopify, check inventory levels. 
If any item has < 10 stock, send a Slack alert to #inventory."
```

## Credential Management

### Auto-Detection

Aventir analyzes your task and suggests required credentials:

```
Task: "Check Gmail..."
AI Manager: "This requires Gmail access. Add Gmail credentials?"
```

### Adding Credentials

**Before Agent Creation:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Credentials**
2. Click **Add Credential**
3. Select service type
4. Enter credentials (encrypted immediately)

**During Agent Creation:**
1. AI Manager detects missing credential
2. Prompts you to add it
3. Credential is saved and linked to agent

### Credential Types

| Service | Type | Setup |
|---------|------|-------|
| Gmail | OAuth | Google OAuth flow |
| Slack | OAuth | Slack app installation |
| Shopify | API Key | Admin API credentials |
| HubSpot | OAuth | HubSpot app connection |
| Notion | OAuth | Notion integration |

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying an agent, verify:

- [ ] Task description is clear and specific
- [ ] Required credentials are added and valid
- [ ] Schedule is correctly configured (if recurring)
- [ ] You have sufficient credits for execution
- [ ] Notification preferences are set
- [ ] You understand the estimated credit cost

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Provisioning

```
[Status: Initializing]
- Allocating virtual machine...
- Installing browser and tools...
- Configuring agent environment...
```

### Step 2: Execution

```
[Status: Working]
- Agent logged into Gmail
- Checking inbox...
- Found 12 unread emails
- Analyzing content...
- Compiling summary...
```

### Step 3: Completion

```
[Status: Completed]
- Task completed successfully
- 12 emails analyzed
- 3 marked as important
- Summary sent via chat
- VM cleaned up
```

## Monitoring Deployment

### Real-Time Updates

Watch progress in the dashboard or chat:

- VM provisioning status
- Login attempts and successes
- Actions being taken
- Screenshots (if enabled)
- Intermediate results
- Errors and retries

### Logs

View detailed execution logs:

```
2024-01-15 09:00:03 - Agent started
2024-01-15 09:00:15 - Navigating to gmail.com
2024-01-15 09:00:18 - Login page loaded
2024-01-15 09:00:22 - Credentials entered
2024-01-15 09:00:25 - 2FA required - waiting for user
...
```

## Handling Deployment Issues

### Insufficient Credits

**Error:** "Cannot deploy: insufficient credits"

**Solutions:**
- Purchase credit pack
- Upgrade subscription
- Reduce agent frequency
- Optimize task description

### Credential Errors

**Error:** "Failed to authenticate with Gmail"

**Solutions:**
- Verify credentials are correct
- Check if password expired
- Re-authenticate via OAuth
- Update 2FA settings

### VM Provisioning Failures

**Error:** "Failed to allocate virtual machine"

**Solutions:**
- Check DigitalOcean status
- Verify API token is valid
- Retry deployment
- Contact support if persistent

## Post-Deployment Management

### Monitoring Active Agents

View all agents in the dashboard:

```
Active Agents (4):

Email Summarizer
- Status: Idle (next run: Tomorrow 9 AM)
- Last run: Success (200 credits)
- Total runs: 47

Shopify Monitor
- Status: Working (started 5 min ago)
- Current task: Checking inventory
- ETA: 2 minutes
```

### Modifying Agents

Via AI Manager:
```
"Change the Email Summarizer to run at 8 AM instead of 9 AM"
```

Via Dashboard:
1. Find agent in list
2. Click **Edit**
3. Modify schedule or description
4. Save changes

### Pausing and Resuming

Pause without deleting:
```
"Pause the Shopify Monitor until next week"
```

Resume later:
```
"Resume the Shopify Monitor"
```

### Deleting Agents

Permanently remove an agent:

1. Navigate to agent details
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Associated VMs are cleaned up

<Warning>
Deleting an agent cannot be undone. Task history and logs are retained for 30 days.
</Warning>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Instructions

Add specific guidance for the agent:

```
Task: "Check LinkedIn messages"

Custom Instructions:
"Ignore messages from recruiters. Focus on messages from 
connections I've had > 6 months. Report any messages 
containing 'partnership' or 'collaboration'."
```

### Retry Policies

Configure behavior on failure:

| Setting | Default | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Max Retries | 3 | 0-10 |
| Retry Delay | 5 minutes | 1-60 minutes |
| On Failure | Notify | Notify, Pause, Delete |

### Notification Channels

Receive alerts via:

- In-app notifications
- Email
- Slack
- Webhook

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

Begin with a one-time agent to test the workflow:
```
"Check my Gmail once and show me what you find"
```

Then convert to scheduled:
```
"Set that up to run every morning"
```

### Test Credentials First

Before deploying, verify credentials work:
```
"Can you log into my Gmail to verify the credentials work?"
```

### Monitor Credit Usage

Track costs per agent:
```
"Show me credit usage for all my agents this week"
```

### Review and Refine

Regularly review agent outputs:
```
"The email summaries are too detailed. Just give me sender 
and subject line only."
```
