Scheduling allows agents to run automatically at specified times, creating true set-and-forget automation.

## Schedule Types

### One-Time

Execute once at a specific time:

```
"Run tomorrow at 3 PM"
"Start in 2 hours"
"Execute on January 20th at 9 AM"
```

### Recurring

Run on a repeating schedule:

```
"Every day at 9 AM"
"Every Monday at 8 AM"
"Every hour during business hours"
```

### Triggered

Execute in response to events:

```
"When a new order arrives in Shopify"
"When I receive an email from boss@company.com"
"When a GitHub issue is labeled 'urgent'"
```

## Cron Expressions

Schedules use standard cron format:

```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─ Day of week (0-7, 0=Sunday)
│ │ │ └─── Month (1-12)
│ │ └───── Day of month (1-31)
│ └─────── Hour (0-23)
└───────── Minute (0-59)
```

### Common Schedules

| Schedule | Cron Expression | Description |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Every minute | `* * * * *` | High-frequency monitoring |
| Every 5 minutes | `*/5 * * * *` | Regular checks |
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` | Hourly updates |
| Every 2 hours | `0 */2 * * *` | Bi-hourly tasks |
| Daily 9 AM | `0 9 * * *` | Morning reports |
| Daily 5 PM | `0 17 * * *` | End-of-day summaries |
| Weekdays 9 AM | `0 9 * * 1-5` | Business days only |
| Weekly Monday 8 AM | `0 8 * * 1` | Weekly planning |
| Weekly Friday 5 PM | `0 17 * * 5` | Weekly wrap-up |
| Monthly 1st 9 AM | `0 9 1 * *` | Monthly reports |

### Advanced Examples

```
# Every 30 minutes during business hours (9-5)
*/30 9-17 * * 1-5

# Every hour on weekdays, every 4 hours on weekends
0 9-17 * * 1-5
0 */4 * * 0,6

# First Monday of each month at 9 AM
0 9 1-7 * 1
```

## Creating Scheduled Agents

### Via AI Manager

The easiest way to create scheduled agents:

```
You: "Check my Gmail every morning at 9 AM and summarize emails"

AI Manager: "I'll create a daily scheduled agent:
           - Schedule: 0 9 * * * (9 AM daily)
           - Task: Check Gmail inbox
           - Action: Summarize and report
           
           Shall I proceed?"
```

### Via Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Agents** → **Create Agent**
2. Enter task description
3. Select **Schedule** as execution type
4. Choose preset or enter custom cron
5. Set timezone
6. Review and deploy

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.aventir.io/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Daily Email Summary",
    "taskDescription": "Check Gmail and summarize",
    "type": "scheduled",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * *",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }'
```

## Timezone Handling

### Setting Timezone

Agents respect timezone settings:

```json
{
  "schedule": "0 9 * * *",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
}
```

Available timezones follow the IANA database (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `Asia/Tokyo`).

### Daylight Saving Time

Schedules automatically adjust for DST:

- `America/New_York`: Adjusts for EST/EDT
- `Europe/London`: Adjusts for GMT/BST
- Explicit offsets (e.g., `UTC-5`) do NOT adjust

### Multi-Timezone Teams

For teams across timezones:

```
Agent 1: "Send summary at 9 AM EST (for East Coast team)"
Agent 2: "Send summary at 9 AM PST (for West Coast team)"
```

## Schedule Management

### Viewing Schedules

Dashboard shows all scheduled agents:

```
Scheduled Agents:

Email Summary
- Schedule: Daily 9:00 AM EST
- Next run: Tomorrow 9:00 AM
- Last run: Today 9:03 AM (Success)

Shopify Monitor  
- Schedule: Every hour
- Next run: In 23 minutes
- Status: Active

Weekly Report
- Schedule: Mondays 8:00 AM EST
- Next run: Monday 8:00 AM
- Last run: Last Monday (Success)
```

### Modifying Schedules

Change existing schedules:

**Via AI Manager:**
```
"Change the Email Summary from 9 AM to 8 AM"
"Pause the Shopify Monitor"
"Resume the Weekly Report"
```

**Via Dashboard:**
1. Find agent in list
2. Click **Edit Schedule**
3. Update cron expression or timezone
4. Save changes

### Pausing and Resuming

Temporarily disable without deleting:

```bash
# Pause
curl -X POST https://api.aventir.io/v1/agents/123/pause \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Resume
curl -X POST https://api.aventir.io/v1/agents/123/resume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Deleting Schedules

Permanently remove scheduled agents:

1. Navigate to agent details
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion
4. Associated schedule is removed

<Warning>
Deleting a scheduled agent cannot be undone. Task history is retained for 30 days.
</Warning>

## Predictive Scheduling

Aventir learns your patterns and suggests optimal schedules:

### How It Works

1. **Activity Analysis**: Monitors when you're most active
2. **Result Timing**: Tracks when you review results
3. **Optimization**: Recommends better timing

### Example Suggestion

```
💡 Schedule Optimization

I noticed you usually check the Email Summary results 
between 8:45-9:15 AM. Consider moving the schedule to 
8:30 AM so results are ready when you need them.

Current: 9:00 AM
Suggested: 8:30 AM

```

### Schedule Feedback

Rate schedule effectiveness:

```
"How was this timing?"
[Too Early] [Perfect] [Too Late]
```

Feedback improves future recommendations.

## Operational Playbooks

For recurring operational tasks, Aventir provides advanced scheduling features:

### State Tracking

Track progress across runs:

```
Daily Email Processing:
- Run 1: Processed emails 1-50
- Run 2: Processed emails 51-100  
- Run 3: Processed emails 101-150
```

### Checkpoint System

Resume from previous state:

```
Agent: "Continuing from email #152..."
```

### Recurrence Patterns

Detect and optimize common patterns:

| Pattern | Detection | Optimization |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Daily reports | Cron frequency | Batch similar tasks |
| Weekly summaries | Day of week | Pre-fetch data |
| Hourly checks | Short interval | Reduce to event-based |

## Scheduling Best Practices

### Stagger High-Load Tasks

Avoid scheduling multiple agents at the exact same time:

**Poor:**
```
9:00 AM - Email Summary
9:00 AM - Shopify Check
9:00 AM - Slack Monitor
```

**Better:**
```
8:45 AM - Email Summary
9:00 AM - Shopify Check
9:15 AM - Slack Monitor
```

### Consider Service Limits

Respect third-party API rate limits:

```
Shopify API: 40 requests/minute
Schedule: Every 2 minutes (safe)

Notion API: 3 requests/second  
Schedule: Every 5 minutes (conservative)
```

### Use Appropriate Frequency

Match schedule to business needs:

| Task | Recommended Frequency |
|------|----------------------|
| Email summary | Once or twice daily |
| Social media monitoring | Every 1-2 hours |
| Inventory check | Every 4-6 hours |
| Competitor tracking | Weekly or bi-weekly |
| Security monitoring | Continuous or every 5 min |

### Plan for Timezone Changes

Be aware of schedule disruptions:

- **DST transitions**: Some times don't exist (spring forward)
- **Multiple runs**: Some times occur twice (fall back)
- **International**: Be clear about which timezone applies

## Scheduling Conflict Resolution

### Concurrent Execution

Multiple agents can run simultaneously:

```
9:00 AM - Email Summary (starts)
9:01 AM - Shopify Check (starts)
9:02 AM - Slack Monitor (starts)
```

Each gets its own VM.

### Resource Limits

Plans have concurrency limits:

| Plan | Max Concurrent |
|------|----------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Starter | 2 |
| Pro | 5 |
| Business | 10 |

Excess tasks queue until capacity available.

### Queue Management

View and manage queued tasks:

```
Queue (2 tasks waiting):

1. LinkedIn Monitor (waiting 3 min)
2. Twitter Check (waiting 1 min)

[Run Now] [Cancel] [Reschedule]
```

## Troubleshooting Schedules

### Agent Not Running

**Symptoms:** Scheduled time passes but agent doesn't execute

**Check:**
- Is the agent paused?
- Are there sufficient credits?
- Is the schedule in the correct timezone?
- Has the agent been deleted?

### Runs at Wrong Time

**Symptoms:** Agent runs 1 hour early/late

**Causes:**
- Timezone mismatch
- DST transition
- Schedule uses UTC offset instead of named timezone

**Fix:**
- Update to named timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`)
- Review timezone settings
- Check DST handling

### Missed Runs

**Symptoms:** Agent should have run but didn't

**Causes:**
- Service downtime
- Credit exhaustion
- Max runtime exceeded
- Manual pause

**Recovery:**
- Retry missed run
- Adjust schedule
- Review error logs
