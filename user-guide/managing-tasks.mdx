Solutions:
- Update task description
- Specify alternative selectors
- Wait for maintenance to complete
```

**Credit Exhaustion**
```
Error: Insufficient credits

Solutions:
- Purchase credit pack
- Upgrade plan
- Optimize task efficiency
```

### Debugging Failed Tasks

**Step 1: Review Logs**
```
[8:00:00] Starting task
[8:00:05] Navigating to site
[8:00:10] Page loaded
[8:00:15] Looking for element: .login-button
[8:00:20] Element not found
[8:00:25] Retrying...
[8:00:30] Element still not found
[8:00:35] Task failed
```

**Step 2: Check Screenshots**
View the last screenshot to see:
- What the agent saw
- Error messages displayed
- Page loading state

**Step 3: Analyze Pattern**
```
"This task has failed 3 times in a row at the same step"
```

**Step 4: Refine and Retry**
Update the task with:
- More specific instructions
- Alternative approaches
- Updated selectors
- Better error handling

## Task Optimization

### Credit Efficiency

Optimize tasks to use fewer credits:

| Before | After | Savings |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Check every hour | Check at specific times | 80% |
| Full page screenshots | Action-only screenshots | 50% |
| 50 iterations | 30 iterations | 40% |
| No early exit | task_complete on done | 30% |

### Performance Improvements

Speed up task execution:

- **Batch actions**: Group multiple operations
- **Reduce screenshots**: Only capture key steps
- **Optimize selectors**: Use stable CSS selectors
- **Cache results**: Reuse data when possible

### Task Splitting

Break large tasks into smaller ones:

**Before:**
```
"Check all our social media platforms, summarize mentions, 
respond to urgent ones, and create a report"
```

**After:**
```
Task 1: "Check Twitter for mentions"
Task 2: "Check LinkedIn for mentions"  
Task 3: "Compile social media summary"
Task 4: "Send summary report"
```
