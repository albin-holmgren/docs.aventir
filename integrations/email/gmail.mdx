Connect Aventir to Gmail to automate email workflows - reading, sending, searching, and organizing your inbox.

## Overview

The Gmail integration enables agents to:
- Read and analyze emails
- Send emails and replies
- Search the inbox
- Manage labels and filters
- Check for attachments
- Monitor specific senders or subjects

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Google account with Gmail access

2. Find **Gmail** and click **Connect**
3. Select your Google account

### OAuth Scopes

Aventir requests these Gmail permissions:

### 2FA/App Passwords

If you use 2FA with Gmail:

1. Go to Google Account → Security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to App Passwords
4. Generate app password for "Mail"
5. Use this password in Aventir (if not using OAuth)

## Rate Limits

Gmail API limits apply:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|

| Per-day quota | 1 billion (for consumer accounts) |
| Per-user | 250 per second (bursts allowed) |

Aventir automatically respects these limits with built-in rate limiting.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

**Symptoms:** OAuth flow fails or times out

**Solutions:**
- Check popup blocker settings
- Ensure third-party cookies enabled
- Try different browser
- Use incognito/private window

### Authentication Errors

**Symptoms:** Agent fails with "authentication error"

**Solutions:**
- Reconnect Gmail integration
- Check if Google password changed
- Verify 2FA settings
- Regenerate app password (if using)

### Rate Limit Errors

**Symptoms:** "Rate limit exceeded" errors

**Solutions:**
- Reduce agent frequency
- Batch operations together
- Use more specific search queries
- Upgrade to Google Workspace for higher limits

### Specific Email Not Found

**Symptoms:** Agent can't find expected emails

**Solutions:**
- Check search query syntax
- Verify email exists in inbox
- Ensure agent has access to correct label
- Check if email in spam/trash

## Best Practices

### Use Specific Search Queries

**Good:**
```
"Find unread emails from john@company.com received today"
```

**Less Effective:**
```
"Check my email"
```

### Limit Scope

Be specific about what emails to access:

```
"Check only the 'Work' label, not all emails"
```

### Handle Sensitive Data

For sensitive emails:

```
"Summarize emails but don't include specific dollar amounts"
```

### Test First

Before setting up scheduled agents:

```
"Run once and show me what emails you'd summarize"
```

## Example Agents

### Support Ticket Monitor

```
Agent: Support Monitor
Schedule: Every 15 minutes

Task:
"Check support@company.com inbox
Find emails with subject containing 'urgent'
Extract sender, subject, first paragraph

```

### Sales Lead Tracker

```
Agent: Lead Tracker
Schedule: Every hour

Task:
"Check Gmail for emails to sales@company.com
