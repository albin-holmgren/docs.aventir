Understanding these core concepts will help you get the most out of Aventir's AI agent platform.

## AI Manager

The AI Manager is your primary interface to Aventir. Powered by Claude Opus, it serves as an intelligent orchestration layer that:

- **Understands natural language** - Describe tasks in plain English
- **Plans and delegates** - Breaks down complex tasks into agent actions
- **Monitors progress** - Tracks agent execution and reports results
- **Learns preferences** - Adapts to your communication style over time

### How It Works

When you chat with the AI Manager, it:

1. Analyzes your request to understand intent
2. Determines if an agent is needed or if it can answer directly
3. Configures the appropriate agent with necessary credentials
4. Deploys the agent to a virtual computer
5. Returns results and insights as the agent works

### Example Interaction

```
You: "I need to check my Shopify orders every morning and 
      email me a summary"

AI Manager: "I'll create a scheduled agent that:
           - Logs into your Shopify admin at 9 AM daily
           - Reviews orders from the previous 24 hours
           - Compiles a summary with order counts and totals
           - Emails the summary to you
           
           Required: Shopify credentials and email integration.
           Estimated cost: 250 credits per run.
           
           Should I proceed?"
```

## Agents

Agents are autonomous AI workers that operate virtual computers to complete tasks. Each agent:

- Runs on a dedicated DigitalOcean VM
- Uses Claude 3.5 Haiku for cost-efficient operation
- Has access to 25+ built-in tools
- Can integrate with 21+ third-party services
- Learns from each execution to improve performance

### Agent Lifecycle

```
Initializing → Idle → Working → Completed/Failed
```

**States:**

- **Initializing** - VM is being provisioned
- **Idle** - Ready to receive tasks
- **Working** - Actively executing a task
- **Completed** - Task finished successfully
- **Failed** - Task encountered an error
- **Terminated** - Manually stopped or timed out

### Agent Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| One-time | Single execution | Research, data extraction |
| Scheduled | Recurring runs | Daily reports, monitoring |
| Triggered | Event-based | New email, order received |
| Real-time | Continuous operation | Live monitoring, chat bots |

## Virtual Computers

Each agent operates on a virtual machine with:

- **Ubuntu Linux** operating system
- **Chrome browser** for web automation
- **Desktop environment** with VNC access
- **Isolated network** for security

### Why Virtual Computers?

Unlike API-based automation, virtual computers can:

- Interact with any website or web app
- Handle complex login flows and 2FA
- Navigate visual interfaces
- Use tools without official APIs
- Adapt to website changes

### Security

- Each VM is isolated from others
- No persistent storage between runs (unless configured)
- Encrypted VNC connections
- Automatic cleanup after task completion

## Skills

Skills are pre-defined capabilities that agents can use. The Skills Registry contains 21 built-in skills covering common business applications.

### Skill Categories

| Category | Services |
|----------|----------|
| Email | Gmail, Outlook |
| Social | LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook |
| Productivity | Notion, Google Drive/Docs/Sheets |
| Communication | Slack, Discord, Zoom |
| CRM | HubSpot, Salesforce |
| Finance | QuickBooks, Stripe |
| E-commerce | Shopify |
| Development | GitHub, Jira |

### Skill Components

Each skill includes:

- **Instructions** - Best practices for using the service
- **Common tasks** - Typical workflows and patterns
- **Known issues** - Documented problems and solutions
- **Credential requirements** - What access the agent needs
- **Risk level** - Low, medium, or high sensitivity

## Memory Systems

Aventir implements multiple memory systems to help agents learn and improve:

### Structured Memory (Moltbot-Style)

Inspired by Moltbot, agents maintain four key documents:

- **SOUL** - Agent personality and working style
- **USER_CONTEXT** - Facts about you and your preferences
- **LONG_TERM_MEMORY** - Important learnings to remember
- **WORKSPACE** - Current task notes and goal tree

### A-Mem (Linked Memories)

Semantic memory retrieval that:

- Stores learnings with embeddings
- Retrieves relevant memories for each task
- Links related concepts together
- Decays old, unused memories

### Cross-Agent Knowledge

Learnings are shared across all your agents:

- Success tips from one agent help others
- Failure patterns are documented system-wide
- Best practices propagate automatically
- User preferences are universally known

## Credentials

Aventir securely stores credentials for accessing your accounts:

### Credential Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Password | Username/password | Gmail, Shopify |
| OAuth | Token-based access | Slack, HubSpot |
| API Key | Direct API access | OpenAI, Stripe |
| Cookie | Session persistence | Complex login flows |

### Security

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with unique IV per credential
- **Storage**: Encrypted at rest in Supabase
- **Access**: Only accessible by your agents
- **Audit**: All credential usage is logged

### Best Practices

- Use OAuth when available (more secure than passwords)
- Enable 2FA on your accounts when possible
- Use dedicated service accounts for automation
- Regularly rotate API keys

## Credits

Credits are Aventir's usage-based pricing unit:

### Credit Burn Rates

| Action | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| Typical agent run | 200 |
| Heavy multi-step task | 600 |
| Real-time monitoring (per hour) | 1,000 |
| AI Manager chat message | 5 |
| Web research query | 50 |
| 1,000 tokens processed | 1 |

### Credit Optimization

Aventir automatically optimizes costs:

- Claude 3.5 Haiku for agents (~12x cheaper than Opus)
- Screenshot compression (50% quality, 1280px max)
- Context window trimming (last 10 messages)
- Early completion detection
- Max 30 iterations per task

## Integrations

Aventir connects to external services through the Integration Runtime:

### Integration Architecture

```
Agent → Integration Runtime → Provider API
```

### Supported Protocols

- **OAuth 2.0** - Secure token-based access
- **API Keys** - Direct API authentication
- **Webhooks** - Real-time event notifications
- **Polling** - Scheduled data synchronization

### Adding Integrations

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Select the service you want to connect
3. Complete OAuth flow or enter API key
4. Authorize the requested permissions
5. The integration becomes available to your agents

## Workflows

Workflows chain multiple agents together to complete complex processes:

### Workflow Components

- **Trigger** - What starts the workflow (schedule, event, manual)
- **Steps** - Sequential or parallel agent executions
- **Conditions** - Branching logic based on results
- **Notifications** - Alerts and reporting

### Example Workflow

```
Daily Sales Report Workflow:
1. Agent A: Download Shopify orders (9 AM)
2. Agent B: Analyze sales data
3. Agent C: Email summary to team
4. Agent D: Post to Slack channel
```
