---

Aventir uses multiple memory systems to enable agent learning.

## Structured Memory

Four-document system inspired by Moltbot:
- SOUL: Personality and style
- USER_CONTEXT: User facts and preferences
- LONG_TERM_MEMORY: Important learnings
- WORKSPACE: Current task tracking

## A-Mem (Semantic)

Vector-based semantic retrieval:
- Embeddings using text-embedding-3-small
- Similarity search for relevant memories
- Automatic decay of unused memories

## Cross-Agent Knowledge

Learnings shared across all user agents:
- Success patterns propagate
- Failure patterns documented
- Best practices spread automatically

## Storage

- Vector database for embeddings
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- Encrypted at rest
- Row Level Security

## Privacy

- User controls all memory
- Can delete anytime
- Not shared between users
- Audit logging
